# pestuse 

This repo lists the rank and best available estimates of mass applied (kg) for the 80 most common agricultural pesticides in Yakima County during 2016, as reported by [USGS Estimated Annual Agricultural Pesticide Use](https://water.usgs.gov/nawqa/pnsp/usage/maps/county-level/) data. The table also includes rank by 3-year average (2014-2016) and 5-year average (2012-2016) estimates of mass applied. Rankings and estimates are based on the *EPest-high method* described by [Theilen and Stone (2013)](https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2013/5009/) and [Baker and Stone (2015)](https://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/0907/).
